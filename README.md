#**Assignment**:

Perform example colabs for below tasks 
a) you should be able to clone partly the colabs but you need to execute it successfully in your environment.
b) you need to do a long video tutorial - going over each of the colab and explaining in 1 minute each what the colab does - this should be your run not the github or copy - you should show it is running in your colab.  you can chunk video tutorials into parts if you want. you need to walk thru each of  colab and explain what is happening.

Neatly organize your github directory with proper readme file - i will randomly load and execute some colabs during corrections. 
Make sure you checkin the full run output (aka the colab with outputs of your run in it - see how to do in github documentation to include all artifacts)
